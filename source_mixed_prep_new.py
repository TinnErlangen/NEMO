#  WAIT - I gotta think about this:
#  I got ico 4 source spaces from the conpy package... morphed FROM fsaverage ... and I should use them
#  and maybe do the same for the subcortical vertex points ...
#  So I should rather create and morph volumetric limb SRCs for everyone (from fsaverage), and THEN add the ICO4 surf SRCs from conpy
#  and THOSE are gonna be my ultimate source spaces
# .... if I could only plot them, i.e. plot "activity" ON them... I would use them for the power analyses, too :\
